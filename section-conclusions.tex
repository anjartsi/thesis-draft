\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
I am overall pleased with the result of this project, though it is far from complete. 
For future work, I would like to implement more problems, as well as create 
more generic tools that can be useful in the classroom. 
One such tool would be a graph builder: a tool that would help users draw 
graphs (directed or undirected) in an effortless way.
