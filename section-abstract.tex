I created a lecture-enhancing AV tool 
to be used by Computer Science instructors teaching Algorithms.
The main objective of this project was 
to create a tool that instructors will want to use. 
My target audience is the faculty at CSUN teaching Algorithms.

Algorithm Visualizations (AV's) are most effective when they are interactive. 
AV's are more than just videos or animations that show the runtime process of an algorithm. Where videos/animations are no more effective than traditional teaching methods 
AV's have been shown to improve student understanding of algorithms across multiple studies. 
But even the most effective tools are useless if they don't get used. 
\newline\newline
I based the design of this project around my experience 
in Comp 496ALG (now relabeled Comp 482),
covering three different algorithms taught in that class: \textbf{Stable Marriage}, \textbf{Interval
Scheduling}, and \textbf{Closest Pair of Points}. 
For each algorithm I created 
an \textsc{Instance Maker} interface to create and edit instances of the problem, 
a \textsc{Solver} to perform the algorithm step by step,
and a \textsc{Display} to show a visual diagram.
